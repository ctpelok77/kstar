Code for implicit abstractions, based on archive provided by Michael
Katz on 2011-01-03. These notes by Malte Helmert.

Modifications made compared to Michael's archive:

 * Removed translate and preprocess directories.
 * Removed build and plan scripts.
 * Renamed directory "seq-opt-fork/search" to "search-implicit-abstractions".

 * In the search directory:
   * Removed .svn directories and some svn-commit.tmp files.
   * Removed .cproject and .project.
   * Removed a bunch of unnecessary files (CODING-CONVENTIONS,
     CYCLIC_CG_DIJKSTRA, DFP-PSEUDOCODE, Doxyfile,
     integration_status.txt, Makefile.depend, PSEUDOCODE,
     landmarks/README.txt).
   * Removed weka subdirectory and weka.jar.
   * Removed cluster subdirectory.
   * Replaced "-m64" with "-m32" in Makefile.
 * Added this README.
 * Made source files and Makefile non-executable.


To build this, run

    ./build_all_configs-release

(That's what Michael's IPC-2011 "build" script did.)

To run the search component assuming that the translator and
preprocessor files are available under the usual names, run:

    SEARCH=$(./dispatch output)
    ./$SEARCH oX L sas_plan

(This is based on Michael's IPC-2011 "plan" script.)
